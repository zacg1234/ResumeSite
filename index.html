                My name is Zach, I am a Chemical Engineering student at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
                In my free time I enjoy working on motorcycles, taking apart electronics, and learning new things.
                I created this website as a learning project in web development.

                            I started UIC in the fall of 2016, pursuing a bachlors degree in Kinesiology. 
                            After taking Organic Chemistry and Calculus 3, I realized that I need something with a larger element of problem solving. 
                            I realized that I wanted to be an engineer. After studing Jewish theology in Israel for 2 years, 
                            I am now pursuing a BS in Chemical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.

                            As I matured in college, I realized that a central aspect of my identity was disproportionately  underdeveloped.
                            As an orthodox Jew I felt like I wasn’t living life with integrity. 
                            I left school and traveled to Israel, to Machon Yaakov, to study Jewish theology for a couple of years (2019-2021). 
                            Over the last two years I delved deep into Jewish law, western morals, and family.

                <h3 id="RF-title"> Royal Flush - an app idea </h3>

                <div id="RFdescription"> 
                    <p> 
                        Royal Flush was an app I made to learn Java and mobile development. 
                        I used videos on “LinkedIn Learning”, as well as online forums to master the skills required.
                        The app is essentially a map that displays gender neutral, and accessible, bathrooms to the user. 
                        This app was meant for use predominantly on a college campus, where these kinds of bathrooms are prevalent. 
                        The bathroom data was stored in a Google Firestore Database. (Click on the images) 
                    </p>

                                <p> This screen would display the map, 
                                    the user could then click on a marker and it would display a short description of the bathroom. 
                                    The user could then press the navigation button and get directions in google maps.
                                </p>

                                <p> Once the user was safe and sound in the bathroom, 
                                    they could then enjoy this jokes screen. 
                                    This screen would display 20 random new jokes upon reload of the app.
                                </p>

                                    I thought that It would be very cool to give students on campus a public announcement board, 
                                    of sorts, which can only be used while in range.
